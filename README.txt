CSC530 Homework #4 Report

This weekâ€™s homework was very challenging.  
I spent the majority of the 4 hours just reading 
and re-reading the paper to try and understand it.  

I also spent time trying to understand Farkas Lemma.
I watched this 30 minute lecture on youtube about Farkas Lemma

I watched these videos on Program Verification

I feel that I came away with some understanding of the topic 

Finally I installed z3 and tinkered with that a bit and 
tried to write up some of the examples without much success.
